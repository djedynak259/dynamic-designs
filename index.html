	            <h5>I hired Dan at Stitch Labs and was his senior level manager. Dan's curiosity allowed him to really grow into his role, which required in-depth knowledge of a technical, constantly evolving product. As he learned more and more, he shared that knowledge through writing support articles, creating internal documentation, and helping his teammates with troubleshooting issues. His compassion and empathy for customers drove him to be creative in his solutions, and diligent in his investigations. He was absolutely a pleasure to work with.</h5>

	            <h5>Dan was such a great presence in the office. He learns extremely quickly and his ever-curious mind aided in his swift mastery of a very complex program. Dan set out to make an impact from day one. Always happy to offer assistance to customers and colleagues, Dan is a very hard worker, detail-oriented, and a pleasure to work with. He's a constant customer champion, helping to troubleshoot and advocate for bugs and feature enhancements that both help the customer and improve the program overall. Danj (as we called him) created multiple tools that will continue to help the Support team for a long time to come. Both technically savvy and great with customers, I cannot recommend Dan enough for any company that would be lucky enough to hire him.</h5>
